## Testing Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Import tests
- ✅ Object creation tests
- ✅ Headless initialization
- ✅ Gameplay simulation
- ✅ Player shooting mechanics
- ✅ Enemy spawning
- ✅ XP system
- ✅ Building progression

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns with modular design
- Game entities as classes (Player, Enemy, Dragon, Arrow, Loot, PowerUp)
- Centralized game state management
- Event-driven input handling
- Delta time-based updates for frame-rate independence

### Balance
- Arrow damage: 20
- Arrow speed: 400 units/sec
- Player speed: 200 units/sec
- Enemy base health: 50 (scales +10 per wave)
- Enemy base speed: 50 (scales +5 per wave)
- Dragon health: 1000
- Dragon speed: 30
- Shoot cooldown: 0.5 seconds

### Code Quality
- Well-documented with docstrings
- Consistent code style
- Type hints where appropriate
- No external dependencies beyond pygame
- Proper resource management

## How to Play
1. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python main.py`
3. Move with WASD or arrow keys
4. Click to shoot arrows at enemies
5. Collect loot and powerups
6. Upgrade buildings automatically as you gain XP
7. Defeat the dragon boss to win!
