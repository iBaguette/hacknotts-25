# HackNotts 25: Medieval Fantasy

The middle ages is a period running from 1066 to 1485 and many developments and well-documented history occurred during this time. 

It started in the Battle of Hastings (1066), where King Harold II was (disputedly) shot with an arrow in the eye as documented in the Bayeux Tapestry and ended during the Battle of Bosworth and the conclusion of the Wars of the Roses. What does this have to do with a hackathon?

## The project


### Outline

A pygame tower defense game. The player/tower is located in the middle and cannot move. 

Click-to-shoot enemies from the centre. Enemies come in from the edge of the map. 

### Plan

- Click to shoot towards enemies.
- Upgrades unlocked with XP "level" but purchased with gold.
- Once enemies reach the tower, it begins taking damage
    - Tower can be repaired with gold
- Menu to buy items
    - All enemies drop XP but only some drop gold nuggets that can be transferred to buy a bow
- Progression: archer -> multi-archer -> hut -> keep -> bombard tower -> castle
- Enemies: knight? orc? zombies? dragon? 

### Next Day
- Leaderboard
- Death effect
- Shop prices for piercing arrow/tower upgrade/reload speed
- Nuke/wipeout option
- Enemy healthbar 
- Boss? Background change (purple) 

### Stretch

- Bow is not 100% accurate all the time
- Dragon boss fight at the end
- The taller the tower, the smaller the player becomes as map zooms out. 
- Bombs
- Blood effects on death/damage
- Health boosts if arrow missed but targeted
- Piercing arrows (an upgrade)?
- Web leaderboard/api with coin records (Cloudflare K/V store?)
